# AngularTesting
Repository to use together with CodeAnywhere to test some things on Angular.

I have no idea why you'd want to fork and see this repo, but, if you do, that's wonderful!
That means you're in a testing repo, and you're actually going to do stuff, which is great.

# Instructions
* Fork
* Checkout
* run npm install
* run bower install
* run npm start
* ???
* profit
